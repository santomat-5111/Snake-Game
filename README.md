#### The snake game is one of my favourite games when I used to grow up and still is, so I wanted to replicate the entire game using JavaScript. The game is designed in such a way that the user has move the snake using the arrow keys ➡⬆⬅⬇.  The snake head is denoted by a red square and when eating an apple which is green in color, grows it's tail long. When playing there are only few rules: never hit the snake's tail with it's head, and also don't hit the snake's head on to the wall.
